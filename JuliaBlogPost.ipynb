    "# First couple of dates with Julia...\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, so I have spent the past week or so getting familiar with Julia. This is a really neat language! It is being heavily developed by [MIT](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-developed-julia-programming-language-debuts-juliacon-0827) and is already finding some very neat real world use cases at places like [FAA](https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/lincoln-labs.html), [Federal Reserve](https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/ny-fed.html), Google, Amazon... Julia was designed as a modern programming language that is capable of solving the two language problem that many people face. I kind of liken Julia to a designer test tube baby spawn of Python, R, and C. It has the ease of development of Python, the pure math pedigree of R and the performance of C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is not a pure object oriented programing language (OOP), rather it uses what is called a [Duck Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) language. This is the first time I have ever heard of it. So, I made this notebook mostly to help myself attempt to understand and learn about the differences between Python's Class based style of doing OOP and Julia's Type based pseudo OOP style. Hopefully my code examples and ramblings can be of some use to others who have stumbled on Julia. [Type-Dispatch Design: Post Object-Oriented Programming for Julia](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/type-dispatch-design-post-object-oriented-programming-julia/) was a good article that helped me a lot. I also spent a lot of time reading the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) as it is very detailed and well written. "

    "Looks like both Julia and Python can populate an array about the same speed(I ran it several times and it was a toss up). But the real takeaway here is that `a` and `b` are not of the exact same Type. If we inspect the two variables we will see that `a` is a `UnitRange` type and `b` is an `Array` of Int64s but they are both of the `AbstractArray` type. \n",

    "Julia has the ability to have a hierarchy of Types. This is not a new concept as other languages I think have this, with both `Float64` and `Int64` being of `Number` type, but what is interesting here (at least for me) is that we can use this as a pseudo OOP.  I wrote this as I was learning and am now revising it after I have figured a few additional things out, but basically all this is made possible by the languages ability to do multiple dispatches. What does this mean? Because, I didn't know what it meant, not being a real `Computer Scientist`. So my naive mind basically boils this down to being able to smartly choose the correct `Type` based on the value given. So if I declare a value `X` and set it equal to `10`, the interpreter is intelligent enough to inspect `10` and understand it is an `Int` and not a `String` or `Float`. This [article](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/type-dispatch-design-post-object-oriented-programming-julia/) helped me understand things and shows how the code gets compiled.\n",

The object then has methods that can be used to get the data or do some type of programming magic related to that object. Objects in Python and other OOP languages can also inherit attributes from parents saving lines of code, and making them easier to maintain. With this in mind I set out to attempt to do some similar type of things in Julia. \n",

    "Till now I've been using method and function interchangeably. When looking at this function called `methods()` and looking more closely at the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/) I think I finally figured it out in my head. Julia has functions, and most things are going to be a function. Functions accept arguments in the form tuples containing different `Types`. These types are constructed via Methods. Each Type can have multiple Methods for construction. So if we look at the following we will see that each Type has multiple Methods that I defined previously. \n",

    "#### P.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so I was already to wrap this up but I read more and found a package that does some metaprogramming to do inheritance. I found a [package](https://github.com/tbreloff/ConcreteAbstractions.jl) that will basically allow you to do inheritance in a more natural way. But I have yet to get it to work with Julia v1.0. I am not sure if this is due to my ignorance or if it is an incompatibility problem since the package hasn't had an update since 2016. "
